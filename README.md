# Notes for Tammy on the changes I'm making
Tammy, I'm trying to keep these things as simple as possible. Hopefully they won't be too too tricky, but there are going to be some html changes needed.

## CSS
You should be able to just include the scheduler-style.css file from this repo, and that'll include all of the styles. It's precompressed and all of that; the source SASS files are here too, but this is really the only file you actually need.
