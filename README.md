# Version 3 notes

This is a punchlist of the things that I see that need changed in terms of markup. Should be continuing to get smaller

## Update the main stylesheet
There's a [new version of scheduler-style.css](https://github.com/redblueconcepts/Naked-Clean-SCHEDULER/blob/master/Scheduler_files/styles/scheduler-style.css) to replace the current one.


## Add the Source Sans font
Somewhere in the head section, please add this:
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro" rel="stylesheet">	
```
(Please note: this was added in the last version, but it currently has a typo so the link is broken).

## Add the mobile-friendly meta tag 

Should be added somewhere in the head section of the site

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
